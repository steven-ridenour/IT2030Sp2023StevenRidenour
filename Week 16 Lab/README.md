#### Instructions:

### 1. During an interview for a job, you were asked about your ASP.NET Web programming class. Respond to the question by listing three things that you learned in the course. In your GitHub Week 16 lab Readme.md file, list three things you learned in ASP.NET Core MVC web programming course. Be specific and include a brief description with details.

### 2.List three features that can be added to your application to improve the application for users. Be specific and include a brief description with details. List your three features in your GitHub Week 16 Readme.md file.

### 3. Code one of the features listed in 2 above and provide information of what you coded in your blackboard submission. Note: The information provided in your blackboard submission should give a summary of what was coded in your project.

### 4. Make a copy of your Week 14 lab files and using the copy, make 4 style updates to your application. Specify the filename(s) that has the 4 updates and specify the 4 style updates as well in your Readme.md file. Include entire filename path when specifying filename(s).

### 5. Upload your zipped completed files to your Week 16 lab folder in GitHub and submit your link in Blackboard.

#### Things I Learned

### 1. The first thing I learned in this course is the MVC architecture. While I believe I had heard of it before this course, I didn't have an understanding of Models, Views, and Controllers, and how they all handle information

### 2. Another thing I learned is what Razor Pages are and how they are used. While in previous courses, I had to build HTML pages in only HTML, with Razor pages I was able to combine C# in and give pages more functionality

### 3. A third thing I learned in this course is about data validation. If many users are using an application they can all enter data in many different ways. If the application is not prepared to handle that data, then it can cause problems potentially leading the application to break. However, by using data validation, you can make it so that the data is only kept if it has been entered in the correct way.

#### Three extra features

### One feature I could add to my web store is the ability for a checkout process. This would include the ability to add items to a cart and checkout via a payment processor.

### Another Feature I could add is a reporting features. This would track customers and users and it would tell me who has accessed the site and who are return users.

### The Feature I chose to add is an articles/blog section. This allows the user to see articles that are written on a potentially regular basis to allow for more content
