#### Phone – 10 digits and include a custom error message to the user, use the RegularExpression attribute to ensure that the phone is numbers only and does not include any letters.

#### Note: You will be able to test the validation added to the ContactModel class using the Contact form

#### Note: We will test the validation added to the ProductModel class in a later lab.

### 3. Add a link for an Events page to your application. The Events page should be after the Tools link and is part of the Home Controller.

### 4. Add an Events view page and include the following for this page:
#### A title for the page.
#### A heading for the page.
#### Four events that your retail store is sponsoring.
#### For each event, include a description of the event and a title for the event.
#### Each event must include the specific age groups that can attend example students, staff, faculty, or all ages.
#### Each event must include a date and time.
#### Location of each event - either online (must specify medium - Zoom, Teams, WebEx) or in-person (must specify a physical address).
#### How to register for each event

### 5. The content on your Events page must be styled with each events' detail separated from the others and use any appropriate Bootstrap CSS classes for styling your content. You may use Bootstrap’s Card feature (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/ for more details) or any other appropriate styling that provides distinction between one event's details from the other. 

### 6. Include an action method that will display the Events page view in the HomeController.

### 7. Run and test your app. Zip your completed Visual Studio project files (including the solution file) before you upload to your GitHub Week 11 folder. Include a Readme.md file in your Week 11 GitHub folder.
