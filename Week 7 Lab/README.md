### Assignment Description:
### For this assignment, you will add a Products page to your retail application. The Products page will include and display six products to customers. We will add a model, a view, and a controller to our application. Start with your completed Week 5 lab files.
___
### Instructions:
### 1. In your Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file, add a link named Products for the Products page. The link will be after the Home link and before the About link.

## Do this by making a copy of the li element for the Home link and pasting it after the Home link.

## Change the asp-controller from Home to Product and the asp-action from Index to ListProducts and change the display name to Products. We will add code to the controller to make this link work in a later step.


### 2. Add a model class to the Models folder, name it ProductModel.cs, and use the instructions on page 55 of the textbook to add the class.

## Add the following five properties to this class which are ProductId, ProductName, ProductDescription, ProductImage, and ProductPrice.

## Use an int data type for ProductId, a string data type for the ProductName, ProductDescription, and ProductImage, and a decimal data type for ProductPrice.


### 3. Add another class to the Models folder to store the data for our Products. Name this class ProductData.cs and store the products in a List.

## You are to use the List<T> generic collection class from namespace System.Collections.Generic to store your Products. List<ProductModel> will be used to store your products. The ProductData class will have two static methods –

# GetProducts( ) which creates and initializes 6 products and returns a list of products and returns a List<ProductModel> objects

# GetProduct(int id) which accepts as input an id, searches for the product and if found returns the product and if not found returns a new product (returns a ProductModel object).


### 4.Add a new folder, named Product, to your Views folder.

## Add two views to your Product folder and name them, ListProducts.cshtml and Detail.cshtml. The Product folder will contain these two views to display products to customers.

## The first view is ListProducts.cshtml (Views/Product/ListProducts.cshtml) and the second view is Detail.cshtml(Views/Product/Detail.cshtml).


### 5. For the Views/Product/ListProducts.cshtml page, use a strongly typed view (@model List<ProductModel>), display a title and a heading for this page.

## Display the six products in a table with four columns and seven rows. The table headings are Product Name, Product Description and Product Price.

## The fourth column has no heading and will be used to display a link to the Detail page. Use a foreach loop to display the products in the rows of the table.

## Display the Product Image and the Product Description in the same column, with the image above the description.

## Apply the table-hover, and table-responsive Bootstrap CSS classes to your table. Add img-fluid rounded Bootstrap CSS classes to the images in the table.

## Using the Bootstrap CSS classes, change the text color of the heading on the Products page to either text-primary (dark blue), or text-secondary (gray), or text-success (green).

## Include a link below the table that sends the customer back to the Home page when clicked. Style this link as a button. See sample image of ListProducts page below:


### 6. For the Views/Product/Detail.cshtml page, use a strongly typed view (@model ProductModel), display a title and a heading for this page.

## Display each product’s detail in a table with two columns and four rows, using Name, Image, Description, and Price in the first column and their corresponding values displayed in the second column of the table.

## Apply the table-hover, and table-responsive Bootstrap CSS classes to your table. Change the text color of the heading on the Detail page to either text-primary (dark blue), or text-secondary (gray), or text-success (green) using the Bootstrap CSS classes.
## Include a link below the table that sends the customer back to the Products page when clicked. Style this link as a button. See sample image of detail page below:
 

### 7. Add a new controller to your Controllers folder named ProductController.cs and code an action method called ListProducts that gets a list of products from the ProductData class and returns the view.

## Code a second action method called Detail that accepts an int id and returns the view for the product that matches the id given as input if found and returns a new ProductModel if not found.

## Include the using directive for the Models class in your ProductController.


### 8. Run and test your app. Zip your completed Visual Studio project files (including the solution file) before you upload to your GitHub Week 7 folder. Include a Readme.md file in your Week 7 GitHub folder.


### 9. Submit your Week 7 GitHub repo link to Blackboard.
